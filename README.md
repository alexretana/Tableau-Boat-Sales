# Tableau-Boat-Sales

As an IT Technician at the Catamaran Company trying to break into the Data Science Industry, I decided to expand my skills with visualization tools, and the most popular by far seems to be Tableau. After this project, the appeal is clear as many different representation are create quickly and easily. 

The data was collected from the company's sales portal website which has been tabulating every boat sale through the comapany since about 2011. The data is far from being perfect, but it is clean enough to pull useful insights. Ten views were created, which will be posted and discussed below.

# Revenue Over Time

The first graph is the sum revenue each quarter since data started being collected in 2011, as well as the average price of the boat.
